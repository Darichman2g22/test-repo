# test-repo
Yesterday i learn about branching and checking out
To branch: "git branch -a"
To checkout: "git checkout with the branch name"
Today, I learn about adding, commiting, and merging multiple files
To add multiple files: git add -A
To commit multiple files:git commit -a -m "multiple messages"
To merge files: git merge plus branch name
Finally, i learned about "git log": a record of all your messages stored or commited
