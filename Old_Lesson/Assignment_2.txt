Everyday comes with a new opportunity, what we do is up to us

This is a new branch call Assignment_1

Yesterday i learned about branching and checking out; To branch: "git branch -a"; To checkout: "git checkout with the branch name"; Today, I learn about adding, commiting, and merging multiple files; To add multiple files: git add -A; To commit multiple files:git commit -a -m "multiple messages"; To merge files: git merge plus branch name; Finally, i learned about "git log": a record of all your messages stored or commited; ssh-keygen plus link ssh -T git push origin first branch

Today is much better than yesterday... i am thankful. Thanks for the video teaching.
